Subject: Update on Extended Internship Period and Unanswered Email

Dear Mam

I am writing to provide you with an update regarding my internship period, which has extended beyond the initially agreed upon three months. Also, I would like to address a previous email I sent that did not receive a response.

My internship has now reached four months. During this extended time, the opportunity to work alongside professionals in the field has been invaluable, and I am grateful for the knowledge and experience I have gained during my extended period here. The additional month has allowed me to delve deeper into projects and contribute significantly to the team's objectives.

If it is possible, I kindly request you to take a moment to review the email and provide any necessary guidance or feedback. Your input would be greatly appreciated, as it would enable me to make progress on the matter at hand.

I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Bishnu Prasad Khanal
